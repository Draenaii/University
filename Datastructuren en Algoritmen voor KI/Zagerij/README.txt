Input:
	There are three numbers on the first line of the input h, b and k, all three ≥ 1. 
	The numbers h and b give the height and width of the plank, both ≤ 1 000 000. The meaning of the parameter k is explained in the section Algorithmic requirements.
	The first line is followed by h − 1 lines with the costs of the horizontal sawing movements, and b − 1 lines with the costs of the vertical sawing movements. 
Output:
	The output consists of one line with two numbers on it, separated by a space. The first number is the cost of it cheapest sawing plan to cut the given plank into squares.
	It's the second number number of cuts in that plan.
