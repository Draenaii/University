Input:
	An input file has several lines. The first line contains a number n. This is followed by n lines, with on each line a string of letters that you have to sort (nothing else). 
	As output you don't have to give the sorted letters, but the program has to print in how many steps you can get from the input string to the sorted string, and a order of operations to do so.
