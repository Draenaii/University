# University
This page contains all my graded exercises for Universiteit Utrecht up until this day. This is from the bachelor of Kunstmatige Intelligentie (Artificial Intelligence). All my Dutch spoken courses I've also translated into English. If the course is already in English, it means that it was a completely English-spoken course.
